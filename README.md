# isa-calculator
A Python CODE under The Standard Atmosphere to calculate the temperature, pressure and density at some point until 105km of altitude from the sea level or above. CODED at Spanish language (the comments and the entire program while running)!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The v.1 (version beta and alpha done, the first 'release' version).
It calculates the temperature, pressure and density.
Entering:
- Last Altitude.
- Beginning Altitude (can be zero, sea level).
- Initial Temperature (can be the 'regular': 15 Ceulsius. It means 288.15 K).

  ... would be nice to improve this, first, to copy and paste a digit so if it has a (,) or point (.) identify it and get the right number, I mean if it has a (,) then the program should 'ignore it'. THis version now what a (.) means and it is decimals, the problem I guess: comma.

Always using The Standard Atmosphere. Learned from DelftX: AE1110x Introduction to Aeronautical Engineering; and Physics' Topics at Universidad Central de Venezuela (de la Facultad de Ingenier√≠a [cod.0333])
